!!! important "Learning objectives"
    - Explore binning results from biofilm metagenomes in a greenhouse gas-emitting cave.
    - Seek evidence identifying the primary consumers (CO2 & CH4) within this extreme environment.

![Cave Microbiome Sampling](../assets/cave1-1.png)
(a) General overview of the cave. (b) Detailed images of the cave biofilms. The dashed line in panel a marks the stable gaseous chemocline between the volcanic gases (below the chemocline) and atmospheric air (above the chemocline). (c) A closer look on the biofilm where mark 7 shows the bare cave wall after biofilm sampling.

Data are precomputed and store at folder /data/precomputed/cave_data containing:
    - co-assembly (3 samples; 2 from biofilm and 1 from the laboratory)
    - Depth table
    - Binning results
