## Dataset explanation

- In the practical you will go from raw reads to
taxonomical characterization of metagenome
assembled genomes.
- In this mock experiment we have a small diverse
synthetic rhizosphere community.
- We expose the plant to fungal chitin and we expect the
plant to respond to this treatment by modulating the
microbial community it associates with in the
rhizosphere.
- Can you find out how the microbial community adapts?
